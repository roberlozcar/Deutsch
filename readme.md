# Language Trainer

## Setup
This project start running main.py, them follow the instruction. 

## Goals
It helps you to train:
- Vocabulary (from one language to another one).
- Verbs conjugations (only present right now, but I plan to extend it).
- Nouns (plural and genre).

## Comments
The comments are in Spanish but I plan to translate them. Originally it was intended for German-Spanish but it can be expanded.

It uses a SQLite database where you can add your custom words. All the words must be in the Dicctionary table before being added in Nouns or Verbs tables.

A GUI is also planned in the future.
